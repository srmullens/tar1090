Initial setup was with flightradar24.com (FR24) and their Pi24 image for the microSD card.
This radar is T-KGNV16
It was first online at 3:06 UTC, 6 November 2021.
My GPS position is recorded for FR24 as: 29.5844,-82.4325
It's running pi24 software version 1.0.28-1

At activation, the FR24 standings include F-KGNV1 and T-KGNV5, 9, 13, 14, 15

To see the planes detected by my Raspberry Pi:
1) Go to https://www.flightradar24.com/multiview/29.69,-82.27/9
	In Filters, select "Radar". Type "T-KGNV16".
	In Bookmarks, select Pi

2) Go to http://192.168.0.13/dump1090/gmap.html

3) Go to http://192.168.0.13/tar1090/
	tar1090 is an add-on program I downloaded.
	The code can be found at https://github.com/wiedehopf/tar1090
	This page acts like the dump1090 page (#2 option above), but with customizable settings.
	- My location is shown via the circle marker.
	- Range rings every 50nm are shown out to 250nm.
	- The theoretical maximum visibility of a 1090 MHz antenna from my location, 
		15ft above ground, is show via a blue line. The blue line 
		represents how far I should be able to see planes
		15,000 ft above sea level. This is set with this command,
		where RH6HG78X is an ID for my location and 4752 is 15000ft in meters.
		sudo /usr/local/share/tar1090/getupintheair.sh RH6HG78X 4752
	- I updated teh buttons at the top to include Low, High, Change, and Circling options.
		- Low: Show tracks of all planes currently under 10kft.
		- High: Show tracks of all planes currently above 30kft and whose initial and current altitudes are within 4kft of each other.
		- Change: Show tracks of all planes who are currently changing altitude by at least 1000 ft per minute or whose initial and current altitudes are more then 2kft apart.
		- Circling: Should identify planes whose track intersects itself because the plane turned around. 
	- I have the table sorted by altitude, while keeping Mode-S at the bottom. See line 1398 and 6009 in script_980d173.js
	The configuration file is at sudo nano /usr/local/share/tar1090/html/config.js
	To get the speed column to work, I had to go to 
		/usr/local/share/tar1090/html/planeObject_980d173.js, line 1245 and 
		replace data.gs with data.speed.
	If something breaks, remove the config.js file and it will be replaced with 
		default values.
	The theoretical maximum visibility lines were aquired through www.heywhatsthat.com,
		following the directions on the tar1090 github page.

To see the last 8 hours of flights seen with my Pi, 
go to http://192.168.0.13/tar1090/?pTracks
	The configuration for this page has also been customized through
		sudo nano /etc/default/tar1090
	To apply the configuration: sudo systemctl restart tar1090

Trying to change the tar1090 "show all tracks" options.
